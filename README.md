## SUPERMARKET SALES REPORT

In this project, Kaggle's supermarket sales dataset is used. The aim is to understand the dataset by using Looker Studio tools. <br>
#### Some insights:
<ul>
<li> Number of customers is 1000, total sales are $322,967, average unit price is $55.67, average quantity is 6, and average rating is 7. </li>
<li> The overall trend seems to show an increase in purchases from January to February.</li>
<li> The Food and Beverages category shows the highest total sales across all three cities, with Naypyitaw leading significantly, indicating a strong market preference or larger customer base in that region for this category. </li>
<li> Health and Beauty products have the lowest total sales among categories. Besides, total sales in Yangon city is the lowest  when compared to not only other categories but also other cities, suggesting either a smaller market size or less focus on these products in the city.</li>
<li>  Naypyitaw's sales for Fashion Accessories are notably higher than in Mandalay and Yangon, which could point to a trend or higher demand for fashion items in Naypyitaw.</li>
<li> The sales distribution across different product categories is more balanced in Mandalay, with no category showing extreme dominance or lack, which might reflect a diverse consumer base with varied interests.</li>
</ul>
